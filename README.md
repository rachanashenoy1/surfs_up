# Overview of the analysis:
This analysis was created to understand the temperature trends in Oahu. The data here will be used to help W.Avy determine if it is a good decision to open up an ice cream and surf shop. This specific analysis was based on temperature trends in June and December to understand if an ice cream and surf shop is a sustainable year round business. 

# Results:
- We analyses between 1500-1700 temperature records in June and December and there was no significant difference between the average temperature the the two months.
- The difference in max temperature was 2 degrees of June (85F) and December (83F) and 8 degress in minimum temperature (June: 64F, Dec: 56F)

# Summary:
- With this analysis, we can conclude that we can make the recommendation to W.Avy to open up an ice cream and surf shop in Oahu as the data suggests it will be a year round sustainable business.
- We could enrich the analysis by looking at more data points for temperature. 
- We could also look to include additional data points such as wind to determine if there is a significant difference in surfing conditions.
